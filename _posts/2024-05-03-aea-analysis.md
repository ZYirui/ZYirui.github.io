While doing Economic Research, there are always a few things bothering me all the time: current research trend, potential collaborators, and literature review. As a result, I worked with my classmate, Shuzhe Zhang, to build up a website which collects all the AEA publications from 6 sub journals, including title, authors, journal, issue, abstract, and JEL codes. With the info we collected, we build up panels which can help people get to know fields and topics which are popular, countries people are interested in currently, and collaboration networks of famous economists. Users can also easily find publications revelant to their study, and download a csv with basic info of all those publications. This website is also equipped with Chat-GPT, which helps people categorize and summarize literature in a very efficient way.
