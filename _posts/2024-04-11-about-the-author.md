Hi there! I'm Yirui. I'm currently a student from the International and Development Economics Master Program at Yale University. I will start my Econ PhD life at UW-Madison in Fall 2024. Besides doing Economics, I am also interested in Computer Science. I share some of my Python works here and hope you will like them!
