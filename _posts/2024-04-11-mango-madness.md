In this project I built up an automated call center to get data on current market prices, production and quality of mangos in Mali. I set up a system and solves the following challenges:

1. The speech to text algo was trained on French, but most of the farmers who call in speak Bambara. I translate from Bambara to French, and then French to English.

2. Sometimes the call just ends, sometimes words are sporadic, sometimes the algo. confuses the word "child" and the word "mango"
The call in number was once the number for the infant health hotline. People still use the number to try to get immediate emergency care for their infant. Their calls must be redirected or children could die and it would be your fault, not to mention an international incident.

3. The call number is often called by fans and musicians who are given the number by directory assistance because there is a music production company called Mango Mali, a fledgling world music group that markets music from Mali to France.

4. Identify who is lying about their crop yield quality and prices.
